# Predicting Climate with Machine Learning
Master Thesis, by Eva Nielsen

This github page is for the code made by Eva Nielsen, for the master thesis Predicting Climate with Machine Learning. 
Most of the data are uploaded to this page but the datafile for the temperature reconstructions was too large. It is available following this link: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/6288.  
The produced spatiotemporal temperature predictions and residuals are available following this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EvRqtGkPKHjm1YB_MnKW4TWBTAkHh1hZ
